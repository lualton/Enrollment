# Enrollment
# Central Office Spending

# This is a project to see how districts change their expenditure patterns in light of continued enrollment decreases.
# Hypothesis is that secondary support services are cut for capital spending that is not as malleable. 

# Ongoing project, code made be difficult to read
# However, I'll be refining when time is available to clean it up
# January 10th
# If significant time passes with no change, I'm just being lazy
